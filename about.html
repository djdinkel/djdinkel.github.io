		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I&#39;m an IT Director living in Louisville, Kentucky.

I also maintain a personal Wordpress blog at <a href="http://dinkel.us">http://dinkel.us</a> that details all of my personal travel adventures. I would also like to better learn how to manipulate the underlying Wordpress HTML and CSS code.</p>
