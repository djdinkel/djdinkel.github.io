		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://uffizi.firenze.it/">The Uffizi Gallery and associated museums</a> in Florence, Italy</li><br>	
			<li><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York City</li>
		</ul>
			<p>I chose to concentrate on these two websites for several reasons.  First, these two websites are in the business of visual art so I wanted to see how their web designers approached the design aspects of each site.  They are also two of my favorite places so it was a bit of a guilty pleasure being able to compare and contrast two sites from these two organizations.  Lastly, because my grasp of the Italian language is limited, reviewing the Uffizi site forced me to concentrate on the design without being distracted by the text.  So, I am not so much inspired by the sites (though I do find both attractive in their own ways), but more inspired by the organizations and their approaches to promoting their organizations.</p>		
		<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
			<p>Both use a large central image space that cycles through a series of images.  They also both adhere to a fairly recognizable grid and column system which makes scrolling for information easy and fairly intuitive. </p>
		<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>		
			<p>Both websites use a main large central image that takes up the complete width of the design space.  Both also have their main menus located above this main image.  Both seem to have an e-mail sign-up option at the top of the website.  They both also use a three column design element under the main central image.  The difference is that The Uffizi site uses both a top menu and also employs a left side menu with additional options which could be confusing for visitors.  The Met chose to put their social media links on the top of the page while the Uffizi included them in the left column of the page.  While the Uffizi employs the three column approach, the middle column is much wider than the left and right columns.  On the Met site all three columns below the main image is the same width.  In these three columns, the Uffizi chose to include many graphic elements while the Met chose to use the columns more for text.  The Met site chose to employ a series of grapic boxes on the bottom of the page below the middle three columns that seems to frame their page much better than the Uffizi site. The Uffizi site chose to continue to use the three column apprach all the way down to the bottom of the page leaving too much unbalanced white space in that area in my opinion.  Also, I believe that Uffizi site tries to include too much information which leads to a site that is entirely too cluttered in the column area.  The Met site contains much less information and seems to acheive a better balance in their column areas using a good balance between images and text.</p>

			<p>I decided to design a website for a high end crafts that showcases different items from craft people around the world.  The two designs for my homepage appear above.  Since I tend to think in simple geographic shapes, I used a simple grid structure with the focal points on each site being a series of three photos that appear in the center of the page.  In design #1, I put each photo directly next to each other without space between the photos.  In design #2 I shrunk the photo sizes a bit, separated the photos and decreased the height of the page footer section.I liked the way that the Metropolitan Museum of Art used this type of design and I tried to use some of the same elements in my pages</p>

			<p>For my individual product pages, I tried to keep all of the header and footer design elements consistent with the home page and decided again to make the product photos the main focus in the center of the page.  Also I adhered to the same simple grid design with a balance of white space between all design elements.  In product page #1 I inserted a picture of the item on the left of the screen which I will cycle through various close up images of the items. On the right hand side of the screen will be a video of the items with the crafts person explaining the meaning and how it is made, etc.  On the 2nd version of the single product page, I made the video the focal point of the page with a five photo carousel below it.  I believe the five photos along with the header and footer frames the page well and adds to the geometric balance of the page.</p>
